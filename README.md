# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jan â€“ machine learning and AI enthusiast.
Recently Iâ€™ve been wandering in the world of ML and AI, working on a mix of university research and commercial projects that challenge the boundaries of what machine learning models can do. 
Currently, I'm wrapping up my Masterâ€™s Thesis in Data Science, where I'm tackling actor-based sentiment analysis on real-world data.

I'm always looking to connect with others passionate about data science and collaborate on cutting-edge projects. Letâ€™s build something cool together.

- Playing music on the piano
- Hitting the gym, tennis court, or enjoying other sports
